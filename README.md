# pingurl
Web request and check response time. A little python script for testing web server. Public internet does not allow to use ping (ICMP) so I replace with web request python to test my server.

# installation

First install python require library from file requirement.txt

```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# How to use

```
$ python3 pingurl.py
```

Enter you target http or https website and set time delay for checking.
